Code developed in Python 3.5 Environment
Written in Atom Editor
Code it thoroughly commented with each and every function and variable in it.

Before running main.py , change dataPath,dataPath2 and parameter in filenames
variable to the paths in your machine.

Data files after processing are saved in another folder for development purpose.
I am providing data files along with code for convenience to run the code
otherwise transformed data files can be generated through code itself.

Follow two steps to run the code :-

  1. Give paths to data files in python readable data folder to above mentioned
  variables in dataPreprocessing.py file
  2. To check output run ~python main.py
